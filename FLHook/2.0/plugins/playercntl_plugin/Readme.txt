characters

The source for the plugin is located in the src folder.  You may use it for
whatever purpose you wish.  If you use it in one of your projects, I would 
appreciate being mentioned somewhere. 

You should be able to get the latest version of the FLHook plugin version from
http://forge.the-starport.net/projects/flhookplugin/files

This plugin is compatible with FLHook Plugin 1.6.0. I will release a 1.6.1 compatible
version when 1.6.1 comes out.

================================================================================
LOGGING
================================================================================

Files ending with "-mail.ini" may be created in the user account 
directories. These files contain msgs for characters who are offline 
when a /pm command is issued.

Files ending with "-message.ini" may be created in the user account
directories. These files contain preset message setting for each character.

A file called "rename.ini" is created in the user accounts directory. This file
contains the time at which a character was renamed. This is used by the plugin
the enforce the time limit restriction but might be useful for an admin.

Reputation changes, ship movement, rename and cash transfers are logged in the
flhook.log file.

================================================================================
IP BANS
================================================================================

When a player is caught in an IP ban they will be able to connect to the 
server rather than not seeing it all of (which is what happens with peerguardian). 
When they login a message will be displayed to them saying "You are IP banned, 
contact an administrator." and then kicked after 15 seconds.

You can grant a known player access through a IP ban by either placing the file
"authenticated" in their account directory or typing "authchar <charname>" in the
flhook console window.

Edit the ipbans.ini to add or remove an IP ban. The path of this file is 
"\My Documents\My Games\Freelancer\Accts\MultiPlayer\ipbans.ini". After
editing and saving the file, type "reloadbans" in the flhook console window.

Lines in this file have the form
<ipaddress> = <optional comment>

The supported wild-characters in the '<ipaddress>' field are '*', '?'; sets: [a-z], '!' negation

The '= <optional comment>' does not have to be present

For example:
192.168.0.1 = Ban a single IP address
192.168.*.* = Ban a range

Edit the idbans.ini to add or remove an ID ban. The path of this file is 
"\My Documents\My Games\Freelancer\Accts\MultiPlayer\idbans.ini". After
editing and saving the file, type "reloadbans" in the flhook console window.

Lines in this file have the form
<id> = <optional comment>

See the flhook_kicks.log file for players who have been kicked because of an IP 
or ID ban.

 [Hooks] and [General] sections.

IMPORTING SHIP PURCHASE RESTRICTIONS
================================================================================ 
Make a spreadsheet with ship nicknames in the first row and good/equipment nicknames
in the first column.

If you put a 1 in the cell that intersects between a good/equipment nickname and 
a ship nickname, then the player must have the good/equipment item  to buy the ship.
Export the xls as csv and import the csv into the ship purchase screen. Delete 
any items in the ship purchase screen before you do the import.
