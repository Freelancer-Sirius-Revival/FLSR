# Freelancer: Sirius Revival

[Freelancer: Sirius Revival](https://fl-sr.eu/) is a multiplayer-optimised complete overhaul of the base game, keeping in line with the original experience and atmosphere of Freelancer

## Features:
### Gameplay:
- Fully customisable Ships - Choose from redesigned weapon classes and weapon types, shields, exchangable power plants, modules, engine effects, afterburners and thrusters, and explore to find completely new equipment
- ...such as Cloaking Devices!
- Ship balancing is statistically even and classes are balanced amongst each other - Everything, from the Patriot to the Sabre, is a valid late game ship!
- New Very Heavy Fighters for Liberty, Rheinland, Bretonia, Kusari and Blood Dragons, completing their sets
- All ships built in Sirius can be acquired - including Trains, Mining and Capital ships (with properly balanced statistics)
- Mining asteroid and gas fields has been systematically reimagined and is properly fun now
- Station-type player ships (Battleships, Liners, Mining Ships) can be docked to by group-members as if they were normal bases!
- Rebalanced Universe - NPCs and missions of all levels can be found across Sirius; All systems offer something to do, regardless of your progression status. You can start your journey in any colony’s capital!
- Redesigned CODENAME weapons (formerly Class 10’s) with all new mechanics (such as artillery guns)
- Reworked trading goods’ prices, mass and cargo volumes and added new commodities to cover missing trade routes
- All systems from the story (e.g. Alaska and Tohoku) are properly developed and explorable
- Many of the existing systems have new content in addition to the aforementioned balance changes
- Cruise speed is raised to 500m/s and Trade Lane speed to 5000m/s
- Ramming other ships deals a lot more damage

### Challenge:
- Tutorial System allows for an easy and forgiving introduction, and lets you start jump into every colony
- NPCs are smarter and better equipped, especially in high-end missions (up-to 4 Million credits)
- Mass of ships, equipment and cargo influences your ship’s acceleration
- Monetary penalty for dying based on value of your ship, equipment and cargo
- Reputation is rebalanced and gained exclusively via destroyed ships and objects for most factions (less binary as a result) and key to unlocking some of the best equipment and ships
- NPC scans no longer give you an extreme amount of time to flee when pirating you or catching you smuggling
- New and difficult areas to explore by yourself or with friends
- Hidden capital navy fleets offer an extreme late-game challenge

### Visuals and UI:
- Higher resolutions for all textures of models, effects and the interface
- New and upgraded effects for both new content and content missing from the base game (e.g. cruise engines of capital ships)
- Increased visibility range and improved levels of detail for objects (including new custom reworked assets)
- The majority of Freelancer’s iconic soundtrack has been remade in high quality
- UI sounds have been restored to their non-compressed original versions or remade in high quality
- New icons for all equipment, ships, commodities etc.
- Additional interface for sub-targeting on the enemy and viewing status of your own ship

### QOL and fixes (examples):
- Network sync between players has been greatly improved (no more large location desyncs)
- Hotkeys to mark and unmark objects for yourself and your group for better organisation and communication
- Countermeasure Droppers are no longer clunky in automatic mode
- Weapons do not wait out their refire cooldown when they fail to fire
- The filter for friendly/neutral/hostile for zones and patrol paths works in multiplayer now
- Stations properly wish you well on your way in multiplayer again (*"Freelancer Alpha 1-2, this is Newark Station; you are cleared for launch - good luck out there!"*)
