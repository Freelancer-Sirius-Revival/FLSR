; This pricey upgrade to the Deluxe Thruster justifies itself in form of a further improved power output at the same fuel burn rate as the previous model. The complicated geometry of the improved nozzle components also makes unlicensed copies difficult. Since Houston New Deal Incorporated presented this new thruster in 804 A.S., its demand and therefore market price have only further increased.
