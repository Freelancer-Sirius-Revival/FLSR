; Assigning level to difficulty is done via this ini.  The format is:

; [RankDiffDB]
; rank_diff = rank, min_diff, max_diff
; rank_diff = rank, min_diff, max_diff
; ...

; wehre RANK is the player's level and MIN_DIFF/MAX_DIFF are the minimum and
; maximum difficulty (same as in DATA\MISSIONS\mbases.ini).  Rank must be given
; in order.  Levels lower than the first rank will use the difficulty as usual;
; levels above the last rank will all use the last rank; levels in between ranks
; will use the highest available.  For example, if only levels 5 & 10 are defined,
; levels 1 to 4 will not be adjusted; levels 5 to 9 will use rank 5; and levels
; 10 onwards will use rank 10.  An example is provided for SP, showing the
; difficulty throughout the story.
