; \
; The Starkiller launcher deploys a devastatingly powerful torpedo that has enough destructive potential to severely damage a small station, and adversely affect any small craft caught in the wake of its blast radius. Despite its power, however, the Starkiller is a slow projectile that is most effective against equally slow or stationary objects.

; \
; This plasma-based Cannon was developed by the Hogosha more than 50 years ago. It was a “present” from Samura back then but during the first tests with these weapons seems that Samura just gifted a failed prototype to the group. In the first days of usage, the weapon detonates quite often because of a malfunction. It took a few years for Hogosha to make this weapon stable and usable.
; \
; Plasma weapons deal +25% damage to graviton and positron shields and -35% damage to molecular and neutrino shields.

The warhead is packed with such a potent payload that it can destroy the shields or hull of a small ship with a single hit, and significantly buckle transport- or gunships. It may be a good strategy to disable or destroy this system as soon as possible.
