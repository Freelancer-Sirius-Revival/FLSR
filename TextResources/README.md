# Text Resources for FL:SR

The mod comes with some modifications to existing Freelancer’s text resources, and its own text resource files. The main `FLSR.frc` resource file is generated directly from the mod’s files.

## Compiling

To generate all text resources and have them automatically be copied into the `Freelancer` directory of this repository:
1. execute `compile.bat`
2. select FL:SR’s `Freelancer` directory of this repository
3. wait for the program to finish and then close the log window
A lot of `.ini` files may have changed their text IDs now, and the DLLs containing texts should be updated, too.

## Using the `ResourcesParser`

See readme on https://github.com/TheStarport/Ini-Resources-Parser
