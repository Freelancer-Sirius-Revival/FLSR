By combining super-hard Diamond drill bits and advanced sensor arrays, however, even the deepest deposits can be excavated with relative ease. When used in conjunction with automated crushers, grinders, and sifters, a complete mining operation manned by only a few key personnel can rip apart an average-sized asteroid within a matter of standard weeks.

; Blue diamonds are an extremely rare find in Sirius. Most often such finds occur in regions of the Walker Nebula, such as in Dresden and the Omega systems, where their scarcity is further amplified by the Red Hessian threat. Due to their rarity and extreme degree of hardness far beyond that of any normal diamond, they are only used for very unique applications within industry or mining operations. Most commonly they are refined and fashioned into high-end jewelry.

Explosives are desired by the criminal element for the production of ammunition as well as targeted terrorist attacks or sabotage. For this reason, many criminal factions are believed to be involved in the production of Explosives themselves. Produced substances vary, but common traits involve ease in synthesis, the availability of ingredients such as reactive metals (often lead or Copper) and stability of the Explosive under non-ideal storage conditions and in transport.

A single bomb represents a severe threat to planetside population centers, and certain warheads are shaped to be effective even in space.
