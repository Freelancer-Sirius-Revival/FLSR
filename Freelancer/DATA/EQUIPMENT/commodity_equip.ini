; A voluminous spherical object of alien origin. Scans show an immense unidentifiable radiation, so strong that the scanners cannot analyze it properly. The obvious dangers and energy signatures of this item will not make it easy to trade. Laboratories with adequate equipment to work with this kind of alien technology may pay a great amount of credits for it.

; \
; Blue diamonds are an extremely rare find in Sirius. Most often such finds occur in regions of the Walker Nebula, such as in Dresden and the Omega systems, where their scarcity is further amplified by the Red Hessian threat. Due to their rarity and extreme degree of hardness far beyond that of any normal diamond, they are only used for very unique applications within industry or mining operations. Most commonly they are refined and fashioned into high-end jewelry.
