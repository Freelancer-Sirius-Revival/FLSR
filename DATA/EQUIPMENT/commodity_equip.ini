When used in conjunction with automated crushers, grinders, and sifters, a complete mining operation manned by only a few key personnel can rip apart an average-sized asteroid within a matter of standard weeks.

; 
; Blue diamonds are an extremely rare find in Sirius. Most often such finds occur in regions of the Walker Nebula, such as in Dresden and the Omega systems, where their scarcity is further amplified by the Red Hessian threat. Due to their rarity and extreme degree of hardness far beyond that of any normal diamond, they are only used for very unique applications within industry or mining operations. Most commonly they are refined and fashioned into high-end jewelry.
