; \m\bHA-06 "Rat" Hogosha Plasma Cannon\l\B
; \n
; This plasma-based Cannon was developed by the Hogosha more than 50 years ago. It was a "present" from Samura back then but during the first tests with these weapons seems that Samura just gifted a failed prototype to the group. In the first days of usage, the weapon detonates quite often because of a malfunction. It took a few years for Hogosha to make this weapon stable and usable. plasma weapons are strong against graviton shields and weak against molecular as well as neutrino shields.\n

It was sold like hot cakes so the administration of Aegeria immediately planned and upgraded the version for it and after a few years, the PBW-5A was born. It was more powerful than the "Stunpuls" but even more power-hungry sadly the "Debildator" never made it into the free shops and was just sold directly to customers.
