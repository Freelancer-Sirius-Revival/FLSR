; This laser-based weapon is the newest development by ALG. the Rheinland Bundespolizei was in the need of a lighter weapon because newer pilots are overwhelmed with the old and dangerous R3-N "Finsterklinge". The new Laser is still strong but easier to handle for trainees and young pilots. laser weapons are very effective against positron shields and less effective against graviton shields.\n

After the war police and military noticed that the weapon was quite reliable and still using it today. Neutron weapons are very effective against molecular shields but weak against positron shields.\n

The Blood Dragons meet some Naval forces in Hokkaido near the Jumphole to Chugoku. the naval pilots were instructed with a suicide mission to seek out the jump hole to Chugoku and prepare a secret attack on Kyoto but instead of carrying out the mission, the pilots joined forces with the Dragons and not only kept the location of the jump hole for themselves but there are also giving the Dragon state of the art military kusari tech. Neutron weapons are very effective against molecular shields but weak against positron shields.\n

During the war between the colonies he started to upgrade his weapons for exploring the danger zone of Sigma to get his hands on some newest military tech from some wreckages of Rheinland or Kusari.
