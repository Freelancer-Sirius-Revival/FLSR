; [FactionScan]
; faction = nickname		; ship doing the scanning
; scan = nickname, ...		; ship being scanned
; dont_scan = nickname, ...	; alternative to exclude factions

; Use either scan or dont_scan, not both (dont_scan will have precedence, so
; scan factions will actually be excluded).  You may have multiple factions
; within a single [FactionScan], and/or multiple [FactionScan]s, whichever you
; prefer.  You can't, however, have consecutive factions sharing subsequent
; (dont_)scans.  Use "player" to (not) scan unaffiliated players.
