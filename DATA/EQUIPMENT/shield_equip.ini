But the fighter that had the shield, fought bravely and even managed to destroy important targets during the invasion of New Tokyo. The main reason was for it is the fast recharge speed of this shield but the main problem was the higher recharge energy drain and the constant power supply needed for this system. That's why the shield was only used on light fighters. Neutrino shields feature excellent protection against plasma weapons but there are weak against neutron and photon weapons.\n

; During the Raid on Heavens Gate 10 years ago, the Blood Dragon managed to find dozens of prototype blueprints in the database of tekagi. Before Lt.Ozu and Edison Trent landed on the Arch, some Dragons hacked into the system and downloaded these plans. It took a few years to understand the blueprints and besides some prototype weapons, the Dragon found a way to upgrade the light "Dragon" shield. Thanks to the insights the new Type-15a features still a good mix of capacity and lower downtime and fits on medium size fighters but also still suffers from a high constant power supply as well as a smaller recharge rate. Neutrino shields feature excellent protection against plasma weapons but there are weak against neutron and photon weapons.\n
