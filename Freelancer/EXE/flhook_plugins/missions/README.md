# Mission Scripting

For each mission you may create one new `.ini` file with any name you wish in `Freelancer\EXE\flhook_plugins\missions\`.

This mission scripting system is mostly a re-implementation of Freelancerâ€™s own mission scripting system. Although there are some differences due to changed requirements and use-cases in multiplayer.

You may start as many different mission at any time. However, only one instance of the same mission can run at the same time.

## Console Commands

- `start_mission <mission nickname>` Admin command (requires EVENT permission) to start this mission.
- `stop_mission <mission nickname>` Admin command (requires EVENT permission) to stop this mission.
- `reload_missions` Admin command (requires EVENT permission) to stop all missions, reload them again from files, and start initially active missions. Do not use too fast or server will crash due to system-blocked INI files.
- `act_trigger <mission nickname> <trigger nickname>` Admin command (requires EVENT permission) to activate the mission trigger. 
- `deact_trigger <mission nickname> <trigger nickname>` Admin command (requires EVENT permission) to deactivate the mission trigger.
- `getpos` Admin command (requires SUPERADMIN permission) to get the current ship position printed to chat.

## Syntax

The following explains the available sections and their key-values. Key-values are always written as
- `key`
    1. `STRING` The first value which is required.
    1. `[FLOAT]:42` Optional value that defaults to 42 and required floating point numbers.
    1. `ACTIVE|INACTIVE` This value has two allowed values: Active and Inactive.
    1. `[ACTIVE|INACTIVE] :INACTIVE` Optional value that allows Active or Inactive as value, and defaults to Inactive if not given.
- `[another key]` This key is optional.

## `Mission`

The head of any mission. All sections following this one will be assigned to this mission. This also means you can put multiple `Mission` into one file with their respective following contents.

To offer a mission on a Mission Board on bases, set at least `offer_type` and one base in `offer_bases`. The `initstate` will be ignored for those missions. A mission from the Mission Board will be only started once the mission was accepted.
